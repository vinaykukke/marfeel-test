## Getting stared

To get the application running all you have to do is

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

The application by default is running at `http://localhost:4000`

## Assumptions

* Graphs inside the donut charts
  * Since there was no information give as to what this graph is or what it indicates, I have determined that it is best that i leave it from the implementation.
* Reasons for leaving the graph
  * I tried to implement the graph using `d3` as we would any other graph. But it proved to be extermely difficult for me to implement it in the manner shown in the designs of the test.
  * I could not get the images of the graphs from the PDF of the test to place them as images, and putting anything else will not produce an intended result.
  * For the sake of maintaining a good design/ look.
